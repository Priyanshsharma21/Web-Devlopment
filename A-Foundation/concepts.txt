/* note if we wanna change block to inline so we can do it by using display property
if we want a sapn which is inline we can make it block and if we want para block we can make it inline 
if we wanna change width of inline which is not possible normally
we use inline block
if we wanna disapper element we use visiblity hidden or display none


DOM, when we proceed further in html css js an tree like structore been created called DOM


units are of two type absolute and relative
Absolute are absolute dont depend on other like
cm
mm
in
px 
pt
pc

this all are the static size means it will not change according to browser size

100% = 16px = 1em 

we use em so whatever the poarent size is it will inharit it nd take referance from parent size 
we use rem so the child size is independent to parent




we use relative if we have a child to be absolute (take ref from parent and move accordingly)
we use inline-block to change dimentions of a inline elemennt



Relative means size depend on other like browser or parent size like

% relative to parent element means if parent is 50px so its whatever % we declesr like 200% so 200% of its parent which is 50 ka 200%



em relative to its size example parent is 16px so its child defint as for wxample 1.3em so it is 1.4 times its parent

rem relative to font size of root it tqke referance from its root whichis html

vw 1% width of viewpoint
vh 1% height of voiewpoint
vmin 1% width of viewpoint small dimention
vmax large dimentio 



the height depend on the content we are writhing html
our child element always reside on parent
like
div
p 
 
 div


position is of 4 type
static which is default HTML 
relative means relative to itseldf
fixed to fix the element
id position is relative then if
top 30px it get push 30px push from top to down 
right 30 means toward right 
left toward left and
bottom so it goes towrd up


specificity 
if we declear same property to an element then browser follow some rule thiw is specificity
most is of inline css 
then internal
then external
last apply css is most priority

how to calculate

Start at 0, add 1000 for style attribute, add 100 for each ID, add 10 for each attribute, class or pseudo-class, add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element.

style(inline element) > id > class, attribut(href,src),psudoclass(hover,visited) > psecudo element
    1000               100               10                                             1






inheritance in color property we use inheritance which means whatever property of its parent acquire by it
Initial means its initial value depend on browser to browser


exception is when we use "!important" keyword then it will become most priotrized




we can use overflow if we want that our data h=which is overlowing will be prevented


object-fit property used to fit that particular objr=ect

uf wanna center element 
if no width use text align : center
if width use margin auto : 10 auto 10 auto
more simple - classic
make div inside section absolute, top  left = 50% and transform translate(-50,-50%)
flex
make parent section flex and 
display flex 
lign item and justift item to center

more advance
grid
display grid
place item center


float is used to wrap on left or right and claer used to claer from left and right


to add elements before an element or after an element we use ::before and :: after psucodo selectors




so we have different typeof selectors

1. *{
     universal selector 
    }

2.  Element selector 

h1{
    select particular element 
}

3. Multiple element 

h1,p,div {
    slelect multiple elements 
}

4. class 

.head{
    head 
}

5. id 

#name{

}

6. p.head {
    p in class 
}

7. h1#name{
    h1 in id 
}

8. .head>a {
    all a inside class head
}

9. .head p {
    head ke andar p ko 
}

10. .head+p{
    target first p inside head class 
}

11. h1~p{
    
}


Position 

relative means uss element ke normal position se kitna uppar niche aage piche hoga
absolute matbal uske parent ke relative
sticky mins stick to top so when we scroll it will stick to the top
fixed used to fix it on its position
float property used to float element to top bottom left right
