Till new we been using it on 
http://localhost:300    & // it is an browser protocol
mongodb://localhost:27017 // this is a db protocole

In order to deploy it we need a web server wjich connect to internet 24*7
nd whenever we wantour data it serve us 

But website with database is workstation not server

So we need two server one for Hpst our website and other for our database 
and solution is Mongodb Cloud server (Atlas)

1. login to Atlas use AWS cloud
2. In security Create User and Create IP
3. Get your MongoShell connands and Enter password 
4. Now you are connect with cloud insteed of mongod
5. You have a cloud database 
6. Now in order to create a database go to collections on cluster and create database
7. Insert document and you can see that new database created
8. In order to connect your app to cloud 
1. Go to cluster-> connect-> connect app-> copy the url and paste on your app local host part 
2. Now when you start your server on localhost:300 whatever you add some data in your app it reflect on out cloud database

let port = process.env.PORT;
if (port == null || port == "") {
  port = 3000;
}
app.listen(port);
