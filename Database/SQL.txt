SQL -> Also called Sequal structure language
It is an programing used to perform CRUD operation on our data 

C-> create
R-> Read  
U->Update
D ->Destroy



1. Create 

Create Table Person(
    item1 datatype;
    item2 datatype;
    item3 datatype;
)

we set a item as peimary key such that to uniquly identify the tuples

ex- > 

CREATE TABLE product
(
id  INT NOT NULL,
name STRING,
price MONEY,
PRIMARY KEY(id)

)

This create an empty table name product

an table with 3 items id(primary key -> not null)
name and money created


2. Insert data in table 

INSERT INTO product
VALUE(1,"Pen",5.0);


3. SELECT ->

Select Column (name)
FROM table name (product) 
WHERE specificity(name="priyansh");


4. Update 

UPDATE table(product)
SET column(name) = value("paper");
WHERE condition

example -> 
UPDATE product
SET price=260
WHERE name="Book"

5. DELETE

DELETE FROM product WHERE manufacture='2002-01-04'

6. ALTER
1.ADD column 
ALTER TABLE product ADD adress varchar(30);



&. relationship
We have different types of keys 
1. Primary key to uniquely identify the tuples
2. Forign key are the attributes that refer to the primary key of same or different table(it link two table)

9. Join -> Used to manupulate two or more tables
Inner Join -> Used to join Matching values of two table
example->
SELECT orderr.product_id,product.name, product.price, product.manufacturedate
FROM orderr
INNER JOIN product
ON orderr.product_id = product.id;
