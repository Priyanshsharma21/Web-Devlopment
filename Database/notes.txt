?      Databases
-> In order to store out data we need a Databases
-> Two type SQL(Sequal query lang) and noSqul(not only Squl)
-> Most popular is SQl, MySQL, MONGODB

TODO-> SQL, databases are the databases in which data store are related data 
TODO ,all the data are stored in form of relation or table.
TODO ,Databases-> Collection of relted data
TODO, DBMS -> AN software used to manupulate that data like SQL 
TODO-> Adv is it is good at maintain relationship
TODO-> Dis-> In SQL databases when we dont place any value to the tabe it place null in front of it 
TODO-> In sql we can create an seprate table for product customer and link it 
TODO->it protect data redunancy, Thisis how we can join two tables 
TODO-> Best use when we have to store data in table hving relation with each other 
TODO-> When we scale the data as millions trillions bits of data is been generated then this is an issue in sql
TODO-> It is like placing an floor above floor until you reach the sky

*-> In Mongo -> Data stored in form of key value pair means json format
*,so if you have extra data its not a problem in it,
*,It dosent follow a strict structure
*-> Not strict but bad at relationship
*-> We can maintain relations in mongo too but it is little clumsy
*-> Best when we have unstructured data like videos audios images
*-> Scability is not an issue it this database bacause it is like you are scaling an colony



! pros and cons ->

?1. -> SQL is more mature and old
TODO-> Mongo is new

?2. ->SQL Table structure but 
TODO ->mongo is document structiore 

?3 ->SQL requre a schema(Proper structure) before Storing data
TODO-> MONGO is more flexible to change

?4 ->SQL is great when there are lots of relationships
TODO-> MONGo is not good at relational data

?5-> SQL scale vertically
TODO-> MOngo scale horizontally
