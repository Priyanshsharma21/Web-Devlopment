Bootstap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

frontend - Html Css Js 
backend - nodejs java php ruby python mongodb sql etc
we can access to templates, documentation from getbootstrap.com

CDN- Content delivery network 
insteed of hosting our website to one server host to many surver to prevent delay

bootstrape do the same for us it host from neared server

downlode it 

1. use this or downlode it

<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">

1. create wireframes, mockups, use dribble for insperation , use pen paper or online wireframe tools for wireframe 

2. for functionality add js 

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

py class is used to give padding of 5 
basic structure of bootstrap is a container class have rows and rows have column (max-12)

Notes - 
in order to use grid you have to make container and in which make a row and keep components in column then apply responsiveness
a row contain max 12 column or element not more than that.
using bootstrap classes we can give layout very easy 
col-(1-12) and div will take space of given

bootstrap has predefined classes by which we can just include it in our HTML and all style respomsiveness is added to it


we have x right or left axis y top or bottom axix and also we have z axis above and below 
when elements are positioned and we want an element to be up or other we used z-index


your code must be neat and for it ypu nrrd to refactor it

Code Refactor
1. readible
2. Modular - resuable
3. efficient
4. Length

advance selectors 

1. select multiple element

 .container,.ss{
    color:red;
}

2. select specific elemnt

.container h1{
    color:red;
}

3. two or more class

.container.title.bg-yellow{
    colo:red;
}

4. element have class or id
div.container - all div with container class 
      or
h1#title{
    color:red;
}

priority of elements

id > class > elements(h1,p,div,span)

note  - Use id very rearly when only necessary only
also use less number of classes for a particular puropose
