0. Backend consist of Server nd Databases and applications
When we enter our details on website it store on backend and wheneer we came back to website it lodes from there only 
We use node js for this purpose to intrect with server 



1. Nodejs

Node is a process to run js in backend
It is  a programe , an runtime compiler, platform, runtime enviroment
it have some library like http and all.
also have npm in which library of all people kept we write npm install _____ and it get install
when we write node app.js then node started reading the file one by one and execurte it

Server Side language to communicate, indpendent of browser 

To run node file that we created we use hyper terminal 
In hyper terminat we have to reach to the file and write 

2. node file_name.js

and boom we are running that file

3. REPL - Read Evulation Print Loop
Inside hyper if we write Node - We enter into REPL and now we can write code directly.

3+2 = 5


4. To exit use 
.exit and for clear to clr

5. We cn use internal packages of nodejs documentation nd 
6. If we wanna use exetrnal packages we can use npm - node package module

go to npmjs.com and we get packages now in hyper we can install package in our dir
It is a library

7. In every project we have to create a server 
steps to create server are :-
7.1 - open hyper
7.2 - cd/user/priya/onedrive/desktop
7.3 - Create mkdir file.js 
7.4 - initlize npm  - npm init and then a json file will be created
7.5 - start file.js and it will be open in vscode
7.6 - Every single time we npm install any package an new dependency added to our npm init json package

8. 3000 is like a channel at white it listen -> look it as a domain, route

 example when we search google.com in s-bar this request send to google servers and the data we want comes from there db and
  it is in form of HTML , CSS , JS

 In this we have written app.listen at 3000 port adress but nothing comes to us so 
 for this 
 lets understand that 
 local host 3000/ is like a domain name 
 when we call www.google.com this request send to google servers ad they see this request then they send responce of it in form of 
 HTML, CSS, JS and we see google home page 
 note / means root page -> aka home page 

 so for the same to be shown in our website we use 

 app.get('/',function(request,responce){
 responce.send(<h1>Hello Duniya!</h1>);
 });

 and now we will get responce on our local host 3000/ --> root pageXOffset, home page 

 9.  *we downloded nodemon in npm so whenwver we save your server we dont have to go to hyper and start our server.js aganin insteed it started automaticlly 


10.  Now how we can include our HTML and make our full flech web application
1. so make a dir anywhere and npm init it 
2. nom install express in it
3. now create an html file in it let say form having action ="/route_you_want" method="Post" so you can do post request
Note -> Inside form -> input use name
4. inside server.js
require express and body-Parser(npm install it)
 then create const app of express
 now use bodyParser so we can parse HTML data and use it
 app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true})); // *whenever we want to parse data comes from html form we use  urlencoded

 then start port at 3000 by app.listen(3000,function{
     console.log("post at 3000)
 })

 now use app.get to get html dir

app.get('/',function(req,res){
res.sendFile(__dirname +"/index.html"); // this will give us the full dir of our html file
});

then post request

  
    app.post('/bmiCalculator',function(req,res){
    var weight = parseFloat(req.body.w1);
    var height = parseFloat(req.body.h1);
    var results = weight/Math.sqrt(height);
    
    res.send("Your BMI Is: "+results);
    });
    



          





          <!-- // using bodyparser using express 
*whenever we want to parse data comes from html form we use  urlencoded
<!-- // *so in express.js apiReferance in responce section we see that we have sendFile method insteed of send  -->
<!-- //  so we can include index.html in our server but this limit in our system only , in practical we didnt know -->
<!-- // the location of our server so we use __dirname so the entire path of our server comes  -->
<!-- // *--> priya/onedrive/desktop/calculator -->
<!-- // and in second para we specify html file.  -->

<!-- // when we enter data in our form and submite  -->
<!-- // 404 not found  -->
<!-- // so open inspect -> network-> and click on index.html we see form data and 400 error  -->
<!-- // *to fix it we will use post request method  -->
//* whatever value we want we type in req.body.num1(is the name we wrote in input) or req.body.num2 then we will get num2 in console

<!-- // * So with the help of body parser we are able to parse HTTP request , and by urlencoder we get the data we enterend in the html form -->
<!-- // *so now its simple with help of it  --> -->



Now to make our website dynamically available not on port 3000 only but host on different servers then we use heroku
make your 3000 to (Process.env.PORT) for same purpose

now go to hyper and check your ht,node, npm versions 
now go to your app.js wala folder and touch Procfile- web: node file.js
now uplode it to git 
hyper -> folder(newsletter) -> initlize git (git init)
then -> git add .
then -> git commit -m"First Commit"
