1. Api are like a documentation between devloper and Provider.

2. API are set of commands, function, protocols, Object that devloper.
use to create software and intrect with external system.

3.Like Googlemap api, crime api all have there data that we can use and include in our 
website so we will not have to downlode it again.

4. Every API has 4 things:-
Endpoint, Path, Parameters,Authentication

Endpoint - The url to access there data 

path - url/path that the website already have specified
Example- url/Programming,Movies(We seprate path by commas)

parameter - url/path/parameter(?key=value & contain=deebuging)
Example- url/Programming/?type=single&contain=Debugging ,
same catogries seprate by commas like (?blacklistFlag=religious,explicit).
space represent by %20



5. Weather API :-
After creating account go to api keys and you can create one or just use 

d722b40b26d2c0362635ce360e47d516

ex-> There are lot of way one of which is get weather by city name

api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}
|------------Endpoint-----------------||-parameter--||---------Our Key---------|

here q = by name of city 
we can get it by zip code or lan-lat

For this purpose of checking API we use Postman 
Using Postman we can get url very easily
just paste endpoint 
then in key section type key and in value type value
you will get your data 
the data we get is in much more structured format
because of Json format 

6. We have different types of formats 
Xml
Html
Json
JavaScript Object Notation Format 

Company:[{
    name:Google
    eid - 765474
}] 

7. The Process

So whatever data client browser want they request (get req) to our server our server give response in form of HTML,CSS,JS. 
If we want data from other external server we request (get req) to external server Using API (Path and parameter) and get responce as data from them.
Our server give that data to client browser in friendly form (HTML,CSS,JS).


            get(req)                   get(req)
client  --------------> Our Server --------------> External Server(Someone Else) 
browser                    |   |_________________________|
 |_________________________|             Data 
       Data(HTML,CSS,JS)        

8. Weather project
a. Hyper terminal 
b. Create midir on desktop as weather project
c. Create touch index.html and app.js
d. npm init and install express

8. While Using https there are different https codes like 
100's - Informationsl responses 
200's - OK
300's - Redirection messages
400's - Errors and themost common ones is 404 not found means the data you wanna fetch throught api not found 

9. JSON.parse is used to make string type object 
ex -> {name:priynsh,class:t-3,subject:CSE}
it convert it to JSON object format 
{
    name:priyansh,
    class:t-3,
    subject:cse
}

and JSON.stringify go opposite


10. For any type of api we need an api key first then use http to get and post req
