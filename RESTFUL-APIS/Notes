REST means 
REpresental state transfer


Our browser works on client server architecture
Client request for data if server have it give (in form of html) otherwise 404 error
Client request is HTTP request 
HTTP is not only request we also have file transfer protocol
HTTPS is secure request (encrepted) defecult to hack
the responce we get depend on the request (It can ve fulfil by server or database)

Building an api is like building a menu like what our server can responce
REST is an architucture style to design the apis
There are more architucture style like Sope graphql


How to make your API restful

1. Using HTTP verbs(language);
2. Use specific pattern routs/endpoints


1. HTTPS verbs

Get 
Post
Put
Patch
Delete


1. Get / Read 

app.get("/",function(req,res){

})

It search and read the data from database

2. Post / Create

app.post('/',function(err,data){

})

It is like create database if created then success otherwise error

3. Put or Patch  // Update
Both goes to database and used to update

app.put is like you are replacing entire entry of database
When we buy from amazon and product is defect we can either replace the whole or 
replace the defect part

Put is like replace whole database
Patch is like you are secding Request to Update the part of data


4. Delete is deleting the database

app.delete({

})



2. Use an specific pattern of endpoints(routes);

Creating REST API

Using database as ROBO-3T an Graphical Interface For our database
After downode go to the connect and you will see all local databases 
There is always command line is best for doung operations but sometimes we need a GUI for doning it with ease

1. Create Database
2. Create Collections(lowercase and pural)
3. Insert Document and write your data here

Steps to setup
1. Create a dir (mkdir nameOfDir)
2. npm init and npm i body-parser, Mongoose, express, ejs
3. Create app.js
4. Inside the app.js add sewrver code
5. Mongodb setup
5.1 Name of database , collection


REST
1. Get Method -> Inside the get method we have Article.find({},function(err,res)){

}
Now when we go to the localhost:3000/articles we will see all the data comes from our robo-3t

2. Now post request , When any client what data from our server we send it in form of html css js, Post request is send via 

app.post(function(req,res)){

req.body.dataField1;
req.body.dataField2;

}

In order to test the api go to postman and make a post request-> go to body and chnge the encoding -> Write the -> Title and content 
when you click the send then you will resive it in post request

now we can create a new article with it using 

 const article1 = new Article({
        title : req.body.title,
        content : req.body.content
    })

    article1.save();


and a new entey created inside the robo-3t



3. Delete -> Delete documents

app.delete("/route",fumction(req,res){
    Article.deleteMany({condition},function(err){
        if(!err){
            res.send("item deleted)
        }else{
            res.send(err);
        }
    })
})

4. When we are working in the same route like "/article"
Its better to use app.route to make chain of all get post delete put parse request

 app.route('/articles').get().post().delete();

 app.route('/articles')

.get(function(req,res){

})

.post(function(req,res){

})

.delete(function(req,res){
    
});


5. when we want a specific article then we can have another get req like this


app.route('/articles/:articleTitle')

.get(function(req,res){
    Article.findOne({title : req.params.articleTitle},function(err,foundArticle){
        if(foundArticle){
            res.send(foundArticle);
        }else{
            res.send("No matching article found..")
        }
    })
})

so now whatever the request send after the article if it is equal to toitle the data will be return from there

6. Put 

this is used to overwrite whole document with new one

app.put(function(req,res){
    Article.update({condition},{update},{overwrite:true},callback)
})

.put(function(re1,res){
    Article.update(
        {title:req.params.articleTitle},
        {title : req.body.title , content:req.body.content},
        {overwrite:true},
        function(err){
            if(!err){
                res.send("successfully updated");
            }
        }
    )
})

when we go to postman and -> Put section inside the body change the title and content 
and inside the localhose:3000/articles/justin%20bieber -> hit send then our data updated with the data we want

Note if you provide only one field let say only content part then mongoose will replace the whole document and title=null


7. Patch 
In patch it replace the specific one only

.patch(function(req,res){
    Article.replaceOne(
        {title:req.params.articleTitle},
        {$set : req.body},
        function(err){
            if(!err){
                res.send("Successfully updated the article")
            }else{
                res.send(err);
            }
        }
    )
})



8. Delete

.delete(function(req,res){
    Article.deleteOne(
        {title:req.params.articleTitle},
        function(err){
            if(!err){
                res.send("Deleted Successfully");
            }else{
                res.send(err);
            }
        }
    )
});
