What is React 
It is an Javascript Library to build Beautiful User Interface

We can break Complex Structure Into Simple Tree Component

Using React We can keep our Code simple and Reuse components(In HTML we have to write lot of code in order to make a navbar) But in REACT we can create our own customize tage and use it

React Combines HTML,CSS,JS together to make a component.

Every Component is indvidual in this language.

It compare the old version of DOM with the new Version of DOM and spot the difference 
such that it make change in that specific componet.

We will use sandbox for React

Inside the JSX we have to put closing tag for every html tag or use 
<img src />  ->  / indicate self closing


import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const randomImg = "https://picsum.photos/200";

ReactDOM.render(

  <div>
    <h1 className="heading">My food</h1>
    <div>

      <img src= {randomImg + "?grayscale"} />

    
    </div>

  </div>

,document.getElementById("root")
)
