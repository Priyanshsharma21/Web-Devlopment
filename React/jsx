1. JSX

First we have a html css and js file all we will do is inside the js file
1. Downlode the dependencied -> react and react-DOM
2. Require it 
3. ReadtDom.render(what to show, whare to show)
4. Using JSX we can write Plain HTML inside the JS file. Behind the seane It is picked by compiler and html compiled into js

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello</h1>,document.getElementById("root"));

Bable is next Generation js compiler , it take js and compile it to format understand by every browser
So insteed of writing lot of code we can do that work in less
This follow morden javascript syntexes like

insteed of const ps = require('ps')
we can do

import react from "react";
ReactDom.render(
<div>
  <h1>Hello Janeman</h1>
  <p>This is react</p>
</div>,
document.getElementById("root")

);

render method can take only one html element so we have to put all html inside the one div

2. JSX also allows us to write Html inside the js and js inside the HTML
To insert js we use {} -> We can only write expression(which result a value) not statemants(Which computes to a value)



import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";

let name = "Priyansh";
let lname = "Sharma";
let num = 10;

ReactDom.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello {name} {lname}</h1>
    <h1>Hello {name + " " + lname}</h1>
    <h1>Hello {`${name} ${lname}`}</h1>
    <h4>lucky Number is {Math.floor(Math.random()*10)}</h4>
    <h1>My Faviout Workout</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Squads</li>
      <li>Deadlift</li>
      <li>Incline Dumbell Press</li>
    </ul>
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
