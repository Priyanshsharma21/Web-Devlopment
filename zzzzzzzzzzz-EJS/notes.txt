 ?but for something like social media post we cant make multiple html for different posts 
 ?so we use template such for different logic our html will change itself



! res.send("Hello"); // use to send our html but once
! res.write("NOw we can send multipe lines")



TODO- Ejs is a tempate writing wich have the syntax of
* <%= variable %>


? We have created list ejs inside view folder such that
when we write 
app.use("view engine", "ejs"); // to use ejs
?It will look inside the viwe folder for the ejs
when we write 
res.render("list", {key:value}); // it will look to list.ejs 



    ! note -> <%= variable to be replaced %> 
    ? This is the syntax of writing the ejs
    *variable use in ejs and app.js must be same
